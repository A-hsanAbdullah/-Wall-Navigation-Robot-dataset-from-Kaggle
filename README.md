ðŸš€ Project Completed: AI-Powered Wall Navigation Robot! ðŸ¤–

Excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed a project where I imported a Wall Navigation Robot dataset from Kaggle and trained a model to navigate within a room with an impressive 99.8% accuracy!

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
âœ… Data preprocessing and feature engineering
âœ… Training and optimizing a machine learning model
âœ… Achieving near-perfect navigation efficiency

AI-driven robotics has immense potential in autonomous navigation, and this project was a great step toward understanding robot perception and decision-making.
